# Changelog

- 4.0.0
  - New Features
    - Implemented **Session Branching**. Session branching allows the SDK to fallback to another menu path if a mismatch occurs in the session. This feature allows devs to model USSD services where the menus are different based on the type of user accessing it.
    - Added a new **Choice** session menu. When a _choice_ menu is reached, the SDK shows the underlying USSD and waits for the user to make a selection before resuming execution.
    - Added **Dynamic Sessions** (by popular request). Dynamic sessions take the underlying USSD and generates dynamic UI from them. The user can then interact with the generated UI as they would with the traditional UI.
    - Added **UI Customization** (by popular request). You can now customize the look of the SDK to match your brand. Use the `AutoUssd.getInstance().setOverlayTheme()` method to do this.
  - Bug Fixes
    - New singleton API. Instead of `AutoUssd.<method call>`, use `AutoUssd.getInstance().<method call>`.
    - Removed `init()` method. A static singleton instance is used instead of manual initialization.
    - Changed session **variables type** from `List` to `Map`. This allow variable reuse within the SDK.
