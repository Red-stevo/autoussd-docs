# SMS Parsers

You may have noticed that when you use some USSD applications, an SMS message is sent afterward to notify you if whatever you did was successful, or it failed.

An example is sending money via mobile money. You’ll usually receive an SMS stating if the transaction was success or it failed for some reason. (E.g. Wrong PIN, Insufficient Balance, etc.)

For the SDK to be able to deal with such a scenario, you can add one or more SMS parsers (referred to as just parsers from now) to your session in your dashboard.

When you add parsers to your session, the SDK doesn’t immediately notify your app when a session is completed. It will wait for an incoming SMS whose content matches the parser before invoking the callback to notify your app.

# Components of a parser

A parser structure is similar to that of a [menu](./03.Menus.md) because they both perform a similar function. You can think of a menu as a parser but for USSD content instead of SMS messages.

| Component  | Description                                                  | Example                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `Label`    | A short name for this parser                                 | *Success parser*, *Wrong PIN parser* |
| `Sender`   | The sender of the SMS message                                | *VF-CASH*                            |
| `Keywords` | An optional comma-separated list of keywords to look out for in the SMS content. <br />If this is specified, all keywords **must all be present** in the SMS content else the SDK will terminate with a `MENU_CONTENT_MISMATCH` error. |                                      |
