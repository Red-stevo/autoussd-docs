# `com.autoussd.models.Result.Status`

Enum constants for report statuses



## Public constants

- `COMPLETED`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.COMPLETED
  ```

  Indicates that the execution completed. 

  > **A completed session does not necessarily mean it was successful**. 
  >
  > **Some USSD services will send an SMS to indicate eventual success or failure**.

- `PARSED`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.PARSED
  ```

  Indicates that the SDK has received an SMS which matches one of the [parsers](./04.Parsers.md) of the session.

- `INVALID_SESSION`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.INVALID_SESSION
  ```

  Indicates that the session id you are trying to execute does not exist in the app in your dashboard. To resolve this, verify that the session exists on your dashboard app.

- `UNSUPPORTED_SIM`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.UNSUPPORTED_SIM
  ```

  Indicates that the device does not have any SIM matching any of the networks of the session

- `SESSION_TIMEOUT`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.SESSION_TIMEOUT
  ```

  Indicates that the session did not complete within the allowable time. This can be caused by the time the USSD service provider takes to process a menu. Try going through the USSD session manually and check which menu consumes more time.

- `MENU_CONTENT_MISMATCH`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.MENU_CONTENT_MISMATCH
  ```

  Indicates that the USSD dialog test does not contain **all** the keywords for that menu. You can fix this by checking the menu text manually and removing any keyword which does not exist from your session configuration.

- `ACCOUNT_SUBSCIPTION_EXPIRED`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.ACCOUNT_SUBSCIPTION_EXPIRED
  ```

  Indicates that your account subscription is expired. To resolve this, [login](https://autoussd.com/) and purchase a new subscription.

- `UNKNOWN_ERROR`

  ```kotlin
  com.autoussd.models.Result.Status.UNKNOWN_ERROR
  ```

  Indicates that an error occurred that the SDK is not aware of. This will be an error from the Android system itself.
