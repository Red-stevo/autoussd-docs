# Terminology

Hi there! In this part, we’ll explain certain terms you’ll come across
throughout the rest of the documentation.

## What Is AutoUssd?

AutoUssd is a combination of an SDK and a web platform that allows Android
applications interact with the USSD capabilities of the device.

This allows an Android application to:

1. Start a USSD session (E.g. dialling `*xyz#`)
2. Interact with the running session (I.e. enter text and/or press buttons on
   behalf of the user)
3. Read responses of an executed USSD session

### What AutoUssd **Is Not**

AutoUssd **is not** any of the following:

1. A service that registers new USSD codes
2. A service that runs on any device other than **Android smartphones**

## Session

Suppose you took out your phone and wanted to access a USSD service (let’s use
Vodafone Ghana mobile money transfer for our example), you’d start with ***
110#** followed by a series of inputs to navigate through the menus, until you
finalize your transaction with your mobile money PIN.

For our Vodafone money transfer example, your interaction would look like the
image below:

This entire interaction, from the dialing *110#, to entering your PIN is what we
refer to as a **SESSION**.

**The goal of AutoUssd as a platform is to allow you to setup these sessions in
your web dashboard which are then executed within your Android application via
the SDK**.

## Menu

In the previous paragraph, we established what a session is. Each step in a
session is what we refer to as a **MENU**. Below is an image of a single menu
from the session above. We’ll explore menus into detail in
the [Menus](./03.Menus.md) section.

## Parser

Usually, after completing a USSD transaction, an SMS message is sent to your
phone. The SMS describes the status of the service you just used. It tells you
whether or not the transaction succeeded.

You can instruct the SDK to read incoming SMS messages from a specific sender
using a **PARSER**. We’ll explore parsers into detail in
the [Parsers](./04.Parsers.md) section.

## Branch

In some USSD services, you might encounter additional menus depending on your
account type.

A **BRANCH** allows you to specify an alternate path for a session. Each app can
have 0 or more branches setup which session menus can branch into. We’ll explore
menus into detail in the [Branches](./05.Branches.md) section.

## App

When building your Android applications, you might use a few or several sessions
per Android application you build. Having all your sessions lumped up can be
quite confusing and difficult to manage.

To keep things organized, you can group your sessions under an **APP** you
create in your dashboard. *In essence, **an APP is a collection of SESSIONS***.

## Conclusion

We’ve talked about quite a bit but the main takeaways from this section are as
follows:

1. A **Session** represents a USSD interaction
2. Sessions are made up of one or more **Menus**
3. Sessions can have **Parsers** which read incoming SMS to determine if a
   session succeeded or failed
4. **Branches** allow you to setup alternate paths for sessions
5. To keep things organized, sessions, menus, parsers and branches are grouped
   into **Apps**
