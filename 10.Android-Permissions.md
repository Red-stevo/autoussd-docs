# Android Permissions

In this section, we talk about the device permissions the SDK requires to function.

# Call Permission

```
android.permission.CALL_PHONE
```

This permission is required for the AutoUssd SDK to **dial and call** the [sessionâ€™s](./02.Sessions.md) **root code** to initiate it.

# Read SMS Permission

```
android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS
```

This permission is required for the AutoUssd SDK to read incoming messages after a session execution. The SMS content is then delivered to [parsers](./04.Parsers.md) of your session to determine whether the session was successful or failed.

> This permission does not exist in the `no-sms` SDK

# Read Phone State

```
android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
```

This permission is required for the AutoUssd SDK to query the device to determine if more than one SIM card is present and enabled. This enables it to present the user SIM select dialog.

# Overlay Permission

```
android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW
```

USSD dialogs by default appear over all other apps because they are system windows. To prevent the user from seeing the dialogs during execution, the AutoUssd SDK requires this permission to display a loading screen over the USSD dialogs.

While the loader is displayed, the user can still access the notification bar and the settings app

# Accessibility Service Permission

The AutoUssd SDK interacts with USSD dialogs on behalf of the user. As such, it needs to:

1. Read the content of the dialog
2. Enter text into the dialog
3. Press buttons of the dialog

The Android system by default prevents apps from doing this unless the user has granted accessibility controls to the app.
